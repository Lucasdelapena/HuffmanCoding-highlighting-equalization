This program is built of python 3 and is needed to run. You will need to install
opencv python. With this project my biggest issue was having huffman part of the code work
correctly. Most of my time was spend trying to understand and trying to implement huffman code

Sample Input:
python P6_highlight.py image.jpg
python P6_huffman.py image.jpg

Installs:
python 3
pip install opencv-python
